## Introduction
The digital age seems to evolve at nearly the speed of light, yet somehow file managers are still learning to take their first steps. Cluttered desktops, folder mazes and the laborious hassle of organizing your files are not tasks the modern computer user should be plagued by.  

Meet Smart File Manager (SFM) your new digital housekeeper!  

SFM aims to take advantage of the power of metadata, natural language processing and AI clustering algorithms to automate file management.   
Whether you are an everyday general computer user, server administrator, tech-whizz or anything in between, SFM will automate your file management needs. 

Lay down some house rules - place filters, constraints and locks on your folders to help ensure SFM is doing its possible best job.  
Looking for that one file from 2 weeks ago that happened to be important all along - Ask SFM to do a smart context search using whatever semantic information you might still remember.  
Navigate your directories with an intuitive mind map exposing the underlying web connecting your files.  

SFM is not just another tool, it's your new digital housekeeper, your AI file finder and your new best friend.
