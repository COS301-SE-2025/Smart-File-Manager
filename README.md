Smart File Manager (SFM) is a digital housekeeper that uses metadata, natural language processing, and AI clustering algorithms to automate file management. SFM can perform smart context searches, navigate directories with an intuitive graph view, and perform smart context searches for important files. It's a versatile AI file finder and a new best friend for modern computer users.

      I have a passion for computer science and started self-teaching in 6th grade. I have extensive knowledge of full-stack web development, including curating a complex backend connected to BaaS systems. For web development, I started off with React, eventually moving over to NextJS. I've worked with MongoDB, MySQL, and Postgres databases, with Supabase being my favourite database provider. Through both formal and informal education, I've gained knowledge in a wide variety of technologies. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming.

      I'm a developer with a passion for learning new things. I've developed projects ranging from low-level C++ database engines and simulations to a production-ready Flask-based job card and inventory management web app for a company. I prefer low-level and backend development and have a strong interest in heuristic-based AI solutions. I aim to provide value to this project, particularly in terms of the concurrency and natural language processing requirements. I always enjoy the thrill of tackling new and exciting challenges.

## 📁 Git Structure

Our repository follows a modular monorepo structure, where different components of the system are organized into separate directories:
- **golang/** – Contains the core backend that handles communication with AI services and the frontend, while managing all file operations and system logic.
- **python/** – Houses the AI clustering algorithms responsible for intelligent file system organization and sorting based on content analysis.
- **protos/** – Defines the gRPC protocol buffer definitions that enable efficient inter-service communication across different system components.
- **app/** – Contains the Flutter frontend application that provides the user interface for interacting with the Smart File Manager system.

## 🌳 Branching Strategy

We follow a structured GitFlow branching model to ensure efficient development and collaboration.

**Main Branches**

- **`main`** – The stable production branch containing only tested and deployed code.
- **`dev`** – The primary development branch where all feature and system-specific branches are merged.
  **Branching Workflow**
- From **`dev`**, feature branches are created for new functionality or fixes. - Once a feature is completed, it is merged back into the `dev` branch after review.
