Deliverable:
Daemon - Functions as expected, needs testing with multiple users and workloads
	-Will need to add functions to dbm to manage user permissions (add users, remove, change permissions etc.)
	
API - Works as expected just needs automated testing

JS Library - Completely unstarted

Version control?
CI/CD - no clue 


CLI:
	Not sure on current progress
	
UI:
	Landing page (done)
	Dashboard (mock data for stats)
	Data view(Clusters done, Collections done, doc WIP, data filtering)
	Query (Basically done except for CLI)
	Users (Currently has own databases, need to add users and permissions)
	
Data encryption:
	Passwords are hashed
	
Architecture: 
	Event-Driven needs to be implemented properly
	Event replay and system recovery optional
	
Unit testing:
	Still needs basically full implementation
		-Mocking, stubbing etc.

Integration testing:
	Partially complete for dbm
	Partially complete for API -> server -> dbm
	

Performance testing:
	Database performance tests around 50% completed (some functions still missing)
	Still need more complex queries

Security testing:
	Penetration testing
	Authentication and authorization
	SQL and XSS attack simulations
	
User testing:
	Involves testing from UI perspective
	Should be automated
	
	
Documentation:
	Everything needs updating and adding to
	Readme defnitely needs a revamp
	
Docker:
	I think it is somewhat completed
