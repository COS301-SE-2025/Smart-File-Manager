## Introduction
The following document serves as the technical installation document for SparkIndustries. It provides detailed instructions for how to download and install the program using the following approaches:
1. Using the provided downloadable installer (The recommend approach)
2. Building the project from scratch via cloning the repository.
3. Creating your own installer (Not recommended but provided for completeness)

**A Note of supported platforms:**
Our application is designed with the intention to be useable on Microsoft Windows, Linux and MacOS. For the purpose of this demo we only provide an installer for Windows, however in the future we will be releasing an installer for Linux distibutions as well (Tested on Linux Mint). The requirement of an apple developer's lisence prevents us from deploying to MacOS. However Mac Users may still build the project from scratch using the instructions provided in this document. 

## Installer

This section details where to download the installer and how to use it to install Smart File Manager to your device. Please note that the Windows operating system might (and likely will) flag the application as high risk and administrator privileges may be required to allow the install. While SparkIndustries is not aware of any risk that the application might pose, we do not take any liability for issues or harm caused to a system by installing the program. User discresion is advised.

### Step 1: Downloading the installer
