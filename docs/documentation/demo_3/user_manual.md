## Introduction
This document aims to server as a detailed manual of how to use smart file manager. It goes into detail on how to use the various features by simulating the flow of how the average user would likely interact with the system. It is broken up into sections corresponding to different features. If any term is unclear please consult the glossary linked [here](#glossary). We recommend reading this document sequentially for the best overview of how to use the system effectively.

**Note:** Please ensure that SFM has been installed on your system. Detailed instructions for doing so may be found [here](technical_installation.md)

## Start Up Page
When starting SFM for the first time you will be shown the following page

Currently there are no managers created so the dashboard page shows no statistics. From the sidebar we can see the various pages available to the user. These include:

1. Dashboard (currently selected)
2. Smart Managers 
3. Advanced Search
4. Settings

We'll now show each page as it appears without any smart managers created (note: dashboard already shown)

### Smart Manager
A smart manager is the principle object of smart file manager. It can be thinked of as a repo which manages all files it has been set to track. When creating a smart manager you may select the root. All content contained in this root will be tracked by the smart manager and any operations that you wish to perform will act on the files inside this manager.
