## Introduction

Welcome to Smart File Manager (SFM), an file organization system that helps you keep your files organized automatically. Think of it as having a personal assistant that knows exactly where to put your files and how to find them when you need them.

### What is Smart File Manager?

Smart File Manager uses "Smart Managers" - organizing systems that automatically sort and categorize your files based on rules you set. Instead of manually organizing thousands of files, you create Smart Managers that do the work for you.

### Key Features

- **Automatic file organization** with Smart Managers
- **Visual file relationships** with graph view
- **Powerful search capabilities** across all your files
- **Real-time statistics** and organization tracking
- **Flexible tagging system** for better file discovery

Smart Managers are the heart of your file organization system. Think of each Smart Manager as a specialized filing assistant.

### Understanding Smart Managers

Each Smart Manager:

- **Organizes a specific user defined folder structure**
- **Shows its organization status**
- **Manages files across multiple directories**
- **Has the ability to sort its folder structure**

### Creating a New Smart Manager

1. Click the **"Create"** button in the bottom side of the navigation bar
2. Choose the name and folder this manager will manage
3. Set your organization preferences (can be found on the managers page):
   - **Max files per directory**: How many files before creating a new folder (default: 200)
   - **Max directory depth**: How many folder levels deep to organize (default: 20)

### Managing Existing Smart Managers

For each Smart Manager, you can:

- **Sort**: Reorganize files within the manager
- **Rename**: Change the manager's name
- **Delete**: Remove the manager (files remain, but organization stops)
- **Save**: Apply any changes you've made

## Managing Your Files

### Folder View

When you select a file (like "notes.docx" in the example), you'll see:

- **File type and size** (Word Document, 2.8 MB)
- **Creation and modification dates**
- **Tags** for easy categorization

#### Available Actions

- **Open File**: Launch the file in its default application
- **Add Tags**: Categorize files with custom labels
- **Delete Tags**: Categorize files with custom labels
- **Lock File**: Prevent accidental changes or deletion
- **Delete File**: Remove the file permanently

#### Search and Filter Tools

- **Search within manager**: Find specific files quickly
- **Sort by**: Organize by name, date, size, or type
- **Filter**: Show only certain file types

### Graph View

The force directed graph view shows how your files relate to each other:

#### Understanding the Graph

- **Central yellow node**: Main folder or primary file
- **Connected colored nodes**: Related files and subfolders
- **Lines between nodes**: Show relationships and connections
- **Node colors**: Different colors represent different file depths

#### When to Use Graph View

- **Exploring project relationships**: See how files in a project connect
- **Finding related documents**: Discover files you might have forgotten
- **Understanding file structure**: Visualize complex folder hierarchies

## Advanced Search

**Location**: Search in specific folders or across all locations
**Date Modified**: Find files changed within specific time periods
**Size**: Locate files within certain size ranges
